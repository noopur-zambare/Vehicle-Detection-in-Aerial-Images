# Vehicle-Detection-in-Aerial-Images

## Dataset
* All experiments are performed using the VEDAI dataset, which contains aerial, ortho-normalized imagery from the publicly available Utah AGRC database.
* The original large field-of-view satellite images have been partitioned into images of size 1024 Ã— 1024 and contain a wide diversity of vehicles, backgrounds,
and confuser objects. The imagery is available in three visible color channels and one near infrared channel. While the VEDAI dataset contains 9 classes of
objects, we focus our attention on small vehicles, namely the car and pickupclasses.
